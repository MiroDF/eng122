<h2>Course Description</h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">University of California, Davis</div>
<div class="line">Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</div>
<div class="line">Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations - ENG 122</div>

<p>Mechanical structures and systems are susceptible to vibrations, i.e. periodic
changes in the physical state. Vibrations can both be a hindrance and a benefit
to machines. In this course, we will learn how one can predict vibrations and
interpret both simulated and measured vibrations using analytical and
computational means. We will cover topics ranging from free and forced
vibrations in lumped-parameter systems with and without damping, vibrations in
coupled systems, electromechanical analogs, and use of energy conservation
principles.</p>
<div class="section" id="catalog-description">
<h3>Catalog Description</h3>
<blockquote>
Lecture—4 hours. Prerequisite: C- or better in Engineering 102; C- or better
in Engineering 6 or course 5 or Computer Science Engineering 30; ability to
program in MATLAB. Free and forced vibrations in lumped-parameter systems
with and without damping; vibrations in coupled systems; electromechanical
analogs; use of energy conservation principles. GE credit: SciEng | QL,

</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
conclusions about the measured system's vibrational nature and describe how
the system behaves with respect to vibration concepts.</li>
<li>Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
about the system by concisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.</li>
<li>Students will be able to design a mechanical system that has desirable
vibrational behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.</p>

<h2>Time and Location</h2>
<p>The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 4:10-6:00 PM in
Bainer Hall 1060.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the exams, you
must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="office-hours">
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>The Wednesday &quot;office hours&quot; will be in the design studio (Bainer 2071). Kenny
or Jason will present materials on vibration analysis and Python skills
regardless if you have questions or not. This is more like a discussion
section, a work session, etc. If you do have questions we will answer them.
Regardless, it is an extra 2 hours of instruction. I highly recommend that you
come.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to make office hours, schedule an appointment with Jason by
checking his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Thursday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the
suggested meeting times at least two days in advance. You can also email Kenny
and request a meeting.</p>

<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>In the past, I have used the following book as the official and required
textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Engineering Vibration</em>, Daniel J. Inman, 4th Edition, Pearson Education.
ISBN 978-0-13-287169-3 [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pearsonhighered.com/program/Inman-Engineering-Vibration-4th-Edition/PGM198634.html">Book Information</a>]</blockquote>
<p>This year, the textbook is optional and will only be a reference. We will not
be following it in any particular way. We will provide you with free online
resources and other materials for reading. Note that many students have found
the above book in paperback for ~$25 via non-standard channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments.</p>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h2>Canvas</h2>
<p>We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select <strong>ENG 122 001 FQ 2017</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be using several features in canvas:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.</dd>
<dt>Assignments</dt>
<dd>The electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
as the course goes along.</dd>
<dt>Files</dt>
<dd>Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be

<h2>Communications</h2>
<div class="section" id="email">
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.</p>
<p>Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
them to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.</p>
<p>When contacting the instructors via email you should default to submitting it
via Piazza (see next section) unless the question is a private matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="piazza">
<h3>Piazza</h3>
<p>Piazza should be used for all questions about the class, homework, theory,
projects, etc that is not of a private nature. Piazza allows both the
instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit. The instructors can also endorse the student answer if it is correct.
The top student askers and answerers, to be judged by the instructors, will be
rewarded with bonus points to their final grade.</p>
