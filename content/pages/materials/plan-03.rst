Review

- Many types of differential equations
- vibrations are a function of inertia, restoring forces, and disspative forces
- 4 step method: create model, derive EoM, seek solution to equations,
  interpret results
- Lagrange's method (energy methods), L = T - U and d/dt(pL/px') - pL/px = 0

Quiz on solution to mx'' + kx = 0

Harmonics
=========

Forming EoMs with Lagrange's method
===================================


Viscous damping
===============

- show them spyder and how to do some things with it
- show them how to print a notebook


Wrap Up
=======

- Copyright of the homework solutions.
- Turn in everything as paper to the homework box, i.e. print your Jupyter
  notebooks. In addtion attach your files to canvas. Run all. We should be able
  to run the notebooks with "restart run all".
- HW 2 due Monday
