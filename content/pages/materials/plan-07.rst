Coulomb Friction

- Linear decay
- Range of equilibria
- Nonlinear behavior

Undamped Harmonically Forced Vibrations

- Resonance ocurs when forcing frequency matches the natural freqency of the
  system. Results in unstable unbounded behavior.
- Beating occurs when forcing frequency is close to natural frequency: slow
  frequency that bounds max amplitude combined with rapid frequency.
