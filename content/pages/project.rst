Utensil/Tool Design for People with Parkinson's Disease
-------------------------------------------------------

Parkinson's disease often causes uncontrollable shaking. This prevents people
with the disease from performing many daily tasks. For example, it is difficult
to eat with utensils because the vibration in the hand causes the food to fall
from the utensil or not make it into the mouth. There are products that damp
the vibrations in the utensil, for example the `Liftware Steady Spoon`_. The
goal of this project would be to design a utensil or tool that could allow
those with Parkinson's to continue the task.

You will need to characterize the typical motion and vibrations that occur in
the task. The task should be one that can be modeled with a planar model of the
arm, hand, and utensil/tool. The idea woudl be do design a passive mechanism
with appropriate damping that causes the effector of the utensil to move more
smoothly.
