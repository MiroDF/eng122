Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations - ENG 122
| Winter 2020, Lecture: MW 10:00AM-11:50AM
| CRN: 77345

Mechanical structures and systems are susceptible to vibrations, i.e. periodic
changes in the physical state. Vibrations can both be a hindrance and a benefit
to machines. In this course, we will learn how one can predict vibrations and
interpret both simulated and measured vibrations using analytical and
computational means. We will cover topics ranging from free and forced
vibrations in lumped-parameter systems with and without damping, vibrations in
coupled systems, electromechanical analogs, and use of energy conservation
principles.

Catalog Description
-------------------

   Lecture—4 hours. Prerequisite: C- or better in Engineering 102; C- or better
   in Engineering 6 or course 5 or Computer Science Engineering 30; ability to
   program in MATLAB. Free and forced vibrations in lumped-parameter systems
   with and without damping; vibrations in coupled systems; electromechanical
   analogs; use of energy conservation principles. GE credit: SciEng | QL,

Learning Objectives
-------------------

There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:

1. Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
   conclusions about the measured system's vibrational nature and describe how
   the system behaves with respect to vibration concepts.
2. Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
   of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
   about the system by concisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.
3. Students will be able to design a mechanical system that has desirable
   vibrational behavior.

Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ENG 102
- EME 5\ [*]_, ENG 6 or ECS 30
- Ability to program in Matlab or similar language.

.. [*] Note that the course catalog incorrectly lists ENG 5 as an optional
   prerequisite. It should be EME 5.

Instructors
===========

| Jason K. Moore
| 2095 Bainer Hall
| 530-752-4805
| jkm@ucdavis.edu

| Gregory Bales
| glbales@ucdavis.edu

Time and Location
=================

The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00-11:50 AM in
Bainer Hall 1130.

**If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the exams, you
must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).**

Office Hours
============

The Wednesday "office hours" will be in the design studio (Bainer 2071). Kenny
or Jason will present materials on vibration analysis and Python skills
regardless if you have questions or not. This is more like a discussion
section, a work session, etc. If you do have questions we will answer them.
Regardless, it is an extra 2 hours of instruction. I highly recommend that you
come.

| Jason's Office Hours
| Bainer 2095
| Time: TBA

| Time: TBA

If it is impossible to make office hours, schedule an appointment with Jason by
checking his `work calendar`_ and select a free time between 8:00 AM and 6:30
PM Monday-Thursday. Send him an email requesting an appointment at the
suggested meeting times at least two days in advance. You can also email Kenny
and request a meeting.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

Textbook
========

In the past, I have used the following book as the official and required
textbook:

   *Engineering Vibration*, Daniel J. Inman, 4th Edition, Pearson Education.
   ISBN 978-0-13-287169-3 [`Book Information`_]

This year, the textbook is optional and will only be a reference. We will not
be following it in any particular way. We will provide you with free online
resources and other materials for reading. Note that many students have found
the above book in paperback for ~$25 via non-standard channels.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments.

Classwork
   There will be in class quizzes and computational exercises. These will be
   sometimes be graded for participation and sometimes for correctness. You may
   have to finish the activities we started in class outside of class and
   submit with your homework that week.
Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week. You will submit these through bicycle.ucdavis.edu.
Midterm
   You will have to complete a two hour in class exam.
Project
   You will be assigned an individual design project that will be due just
   before the final exam start time. You will submit a report and give a 5
   minute lightning talk during the scheduled exam period.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **ENG 122 001 FQ 2017**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   The electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communications
==============

Email
-----

Personal electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your
UCD email address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
them to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.

When contacting the instructors via email you should default to submitting it
via Piazza (see next section) unless the question is a private matter.

Canvas Discussions
------------------

Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class, homework,
theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. Discussions allows both
the instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole
classes benefit. The instructors can also endorse the student answer if it is
correct.  The top student askers and answerers, to be judged by the
instructors, will be rewarded with bonus points to their final grade.
