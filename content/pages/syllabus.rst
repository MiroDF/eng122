Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations - ENG 122
| Winter 2020, Lecture: MW 10:00AM-11:50AM, Bainer Hall 1130
| CRN: 77345

Mechanical structures and systems are susceptible to vibrations, i.e. periodic
changes in the physical state. Vibrations can both be a hindrance and a benefit
to machines. In this course, we will learn how one can predict vibrations and
interpret both simulated and measured vibrations using analytical and
computational means. We will cover topics ranging from free and forced
vibrations in lumped-parameter systems with and without damping, vibrations in
coupled systems, electromechanical analogs, and use of energy conservation
principles.

Catalog Description
-------------------

   Lecture—4 hours. Prerequisite: C- or better in Engineering 102; C- or better
   in Engineering 6 or course 5 or Computer Science Engineering 30; ability to
   program in MATLAB. Free and forced vibrations in lumped-parameter systems
   with and without damping; vibrations in coupled systems; electromechanical
   analogs; use of energy conservation principles. GE credit: SciEng | QL,

Learning Objectives
-------------------

There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:

1. Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
   conclusions about the measured system's vibrational nature and describe how
   the system behaves with respect to vibration concepts.
2. Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
   of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
   about the system by concisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.
3. Students will be able to design a mechanical system that has desirable
   vibrational behavior.

Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ENG 102
- EME 5\ [*]_, ENG 6 or ECS 30
- Ability to program in Matlab or similar language.

.. [*] Note that the course catalog incorrectly lists ENG 5 as an optional
   prerequisite. It should be EME 5.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution and presentation of the work. Keep in
mind that actually doing all of the homework yourself is critical for learning
and passing the course.

You may discuss your projects with others but the presented text, code,
figures, and other materials in the reports must be created solely by yourself.

Textbook
========

There is no assigned textbook for the course but you may want to obtain a
mechanical vibrations textbook for reference. There are numerous books on the
subject that all present essentially the same materials. Here are some options:

*Mechanical Vibrations*, J.P. Den Hartog
   This is the first an most widely read book on the subject. For those that
   want the classic perspective.
*Engineering Vibration*, Daniel J. Inman, 4th Edition, Pearson Education.
   Book that was used for this course in the recent past.
*Mechanical Vibrations*, Singiresu S. Rao, 2016
   Highly cited text.
*Mechanical Vibrations: Theory and Applications*, Tse, Morse, and Hinkle, 1978

Classwork
   There will be a large number of in class computational exercises. These will
   be graded for participation and/or correctness. You may have to finish the
   activities we started in class outside of class and submit with your
   homework that week.
Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week.
Project
   You will select a course project from a set of options provided by the
   instructors or one that you choose yourself. Approximately, midway through
   you will turn in a midterm report detailing a model that you develop for
   your system. At the end of the course, you will submit a report and give a 5
   minute lightning talk during the scheduled exam period detailing the
   modeling, analysis, and design aspects of your project.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **ENG 122 001 WQ 2020**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be the instructors' primary communication avenue to you. These
   announcements will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You
   are expected to read these either through your email program or on the
   Canvas website.
Assignments
   The electronic assignments will be listed here but will be distributed and
   collected through the JuyterHub.
Discussions
   Canvas discussions should be used for all questions about the class,
   homework, theory, projects, etc that is not of a private nature. Discussions
   allows both the instructors and students to collectively answer questions
   for the whole classes benefit. When considering contacting the instructors
   via email you should default to submitting it via Discussions unless the
   question is a private matter.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Accomodation
============

The primary instructor should be informed of any learning accommodations at
least 1 full week before the desired accommodation is needed. I expect students
to contact me to discuss any special arrangements with 1 week time to make and
agree on the arrangements.

Computers
=========

All of the in-class exercises will be done on a personal computing device
(preferably one with a keyboard) that you will be expected to bring to class.
If you do not have a suitable computing device that you can bring to class, you
will need to let the primary instructor know the day of the first class period.
